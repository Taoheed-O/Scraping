You have complete the three tasks given before being able to receive next day payment, but once all tasks are completed and a payment is processed, one of the tasks goes back to uncompleted causing you to have to wait two business days again to receive your money. Customer service SUCKS because the ONLY option given is to send an email (no number to call) and no one EVER responds.
